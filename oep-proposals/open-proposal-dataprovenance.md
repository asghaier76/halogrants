# Project Description

IoT networks bring value by integrating data from different sources, which can be problematic due to network heterogeneity and dynamic nature. Questioning how to authenticate the sources of the data raises the concern of IoT network vulnerability and the possibility of manipulating and inserting inauthentic records along the data path. This problem can be addressed using the techniques of data provenance and verifiable claims.
Data provenance allows a verifying party to check datasetsâ€™ authenticity to the origin.
That can enable tracking the dataset throughout the data path from the source where it is gathered through all the processing pipeline and thus offer the capability to identify any
inauthentic data handling. Moreover, open data models are becomingvmainstream for distributing IoT datasets, which requires a mechanism that can provevdata derivatives authenticity, and ownership.

## Solution

The proposal suggests a new concept that builds a trusted data chain where datasets generated and processed are stamped using the actor DID signature and presented as verifiable credentials traced to its origin.

In describing the proposed concept, a smart vehicular network is used. It is assumed that the vehicles are equipped with a set of sensors that collect information for use by internal subsystems or external entities in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2X) data exchanges.

Building a verifiable vehicular network data path combines a set of components that include first the vehicular network elements (which in general can be any IoT and sensor network) and the components responsible for maintaining data provenance (which will be the IoTeX blockchain and the iotex did method).

## Verifiable DID/VC Data Paths

In this proposalm DIDs and VCs are the cornerstones for establishing secure and provenant data chains. To achieve global provenance, each sensor with processing capability is assigned a unique DID at manufacturing, and each processing unit, including the vehicle itself, is also assigned a DID. DIDs are also assigned to infrastructure elements in case of V2X data exchange, and to complete the path also entities and processing engines (a data pre-processing or ML algorithm) should be assigned their respective DIDs,

Generating a verifiable data path is achieved through a series of steps that create a verifiable claim (VC) for each data record or set of records. Deciding on the number of records that
share a VC depends on the data record size and frequency of data generation. Each VC has a size of a few hundred bytes, thus adding a VC for each data record might constitute
a significant overhead. The generation of a VC for a set of data records utilizes DIDs, Blockchain, and cryptography functions represented by hashing and digital signature.

## Verifying Claims

On the consuming side, once a dataset is obtained by an entity, the origin and authenticity of the data are verified by first hashing the dataset and verifying it against the latest
VC. For a transformed dataset, multiple VCs exist, and the process requires verifying the signature of the proof of each VC against the DID of the corresponding actor.
To ensure that the data throughout the path has not been manipulated, a VC shall contain a link to the previously issued VC represented by the transaction hash. Thus,
by verifying all the transactions, it ensures that the trail of transformation is authentic.
So, each VC ensures that the action performed is actually performed by the same actor according to the DID, while the chain of transactions hashes confirm that the path is intact.

## Linked Data Proofs

The proposed concept will utilize the iotex did method and by generating VC to build a provenance trace and a data chain that enables linking the verifiable claims issued for the data set and its derivatives. The suggested approach allows the extraction of the provenance trace by linking the data proofs using the hash of the previous VC. Upon querying the blockchain for a specific VC hash, the returned object contains the previous VC id, which is a URL to access the VC. Repeatedly, the verifier pulls the dataset using the id record in the credentialsSubject field hash it and verifies it against the VC proof.
The process continues until reaching the original dataset for which the corresponding VC record on-chain has a null value for the URL, indicating it is the genesis VC.
Since certain datasets may propagate through different actors while remaining the same, building a trace of data provenance requires the capability to authenticate the integrity
and ownership of the dataset with a compact representation. A VC representation, in this case, can include instead of the proof field a proof chain field. A proof chain is useful to
allow validating a data set that has been signed by multiple entities while the order of proofs generation is important

## Deliverables

The main deliverable is to build a system that uses the iotex did method and blockchain to deliver the above mentioned concept.
The system will have the capability to issue dids based on iotex did method and enable generating and verifying iot data provenance records.
