# Project Description

IoTeXPlug is a browser extension enabling users and developers to interact with the IoTeX Blockchain through the browser. The project will target implementing the capability of creating wallets using a mnemonic sentence. Also with having the user to be able to import an existing wallet using the mnemonic sentence.
The extension will allow the user to have password protected wallet, by storing the wallet info locally in encrypted format.
Other functionality will include 
- User capabilty to export accountâ€™s private key. 
- Account balance query.
- View transaction history.
- Send and transfer coins.
- Receive coins by displaying account address as a QR code.
- Capability to inject in opened website as a js object to access wallet functions for submitting transactions or querying the chain.

IoTeXPlug is meant to enable an easier way for maintaining wallets and accounts information and storing credentials. An end user will be able to save his account and wallet info in the extension and use the tool to interact with the IoTeX Blockchain by creating a new account or importing an existing one. Users can switch between testnet and mainnet. For developers, the tool should enable developers to build dapps so that the web app can access an injected object and interact through the APIs or SDK with the IoTeX Blockchain.

## Deliverables

The deliverable of this project should be a functioning IoTeX browser extension based on the functionalities described in the section above. The capabilities include main capability to an IoTeX for users and also injecting the browser object that allows for the developer to build dapps.

## Development Roadmap

Please break up your development work into a clear set of milestones. You can use the milestones suggested in the RFP or create your own. This section needs to be very detailed (will vary on the project, but aim for around 2 pages for this section).

For each milestone, please describe:
- First Phase: Initial plugin will be built to include major wallet capabilties as in above - 400k IOTX - 3 weeks from starting date
- Second Phase: Having added the capability to inject in opened website as a js object to access wallet functions - 800k IOTX - 8 weeks from start date
- Final Phase: End to End testing and documentation - 300k IOTX - 10 weeks from start date 

## Total Budget Requested

Total Budget for the project is 1,500,000 IOTX

1. UX/UI - 100k IOTX
2. First Phase: Basic Wallet Functionality -300k IOTX
3. Second Phase: Browser Object Injection - 800k IOTX
4. Testing and Documentation - 300k IOTX

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

The plugin is going to be Open Source so contribution from the overall community will be made available. The documentation will include archtecture and design factors so it can be maintained easily.
